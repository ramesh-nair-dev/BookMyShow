# 🎬 BookMyShow Clone – Backend System  

A full-fledged **ticket booking system** designed with the mindset of building a **real product**, not a demo.  
Every component — from entities to services — reflects principles of **clean architecture, scalability, and domain-driven design**.  

---

## 🚀 What Makes This Implementation Different  
Most projects implement “features.”  
This one implements **systems thinking**:  

- **Domain-Driven Entities**  
  `Movie`, `Show`, `Seat`, `Booking`, `Payment` — each modeled as a first-class concept in the problem space.  

- **Layered Architecture**  
  Controllers → Services → Repositories → DTOs → Entities.  
  Clear separation of concerns ensures **extensibility without code rot**.  

- **Workflow-Oriented Design**  
  Booking, payments, pricing, seat availability — all flow like they would in a **production-grade system**.  

- **State & Error Modeling**  
  Strongly typed enums (`BookingStatus`, `PaymentStatus`, `ShowSeatStatus`) guarantee correctness and prevent hidden bugs.  

- **Pricing Engine**  
  `PriceCalculatorService` decouples business rules from booking logic — allowing easy integration of promotions or dynamic pricing.  

This isn’t a CRUD showcase. It’s an **engineering solution to a real-world domain**.

## ⚙️ Core Features
- User signup & management  
- Booking creation & tracking  
- Seat availability & types  
- Dynamic price calculation  
- Payment flow with multiple modes  
- Robust status tracking (booking, seat, payment)  

---

## 🧠 Engineering Insights Reflected Here  
- **Decoupling for evolution** → Payments, pricing, and booking can evolve independently.  
- **System extensibility** → Adding a new payment gateway or seat type requires no breaking changes.  
- **Error resilience** → Status enums enforce legal system states at compile time.  
- **Clean contracts** → DTOs isolate the API from internal models, preventing accidental leaks.

## 🏆 Takeaway

This project is not just “working code.”
It’s a **blueprint of how enterprise systems are designed**: layered, extensible, and production-ready.

Anyone reading the code will instantly see the difference between a CRUD demo and a system built with an **engineer’s mindset**.
